{"name":"Jonathan Ho","tagline":"Web Developer Â· New York NY","body":"> I am a **Web Developer** with a powerful and varied skillset that caters to **Front-End Application Development** using the AngularJS framework, with which I specialise in **Platform-Agnostic**, **Mobile-Friendly**, **Responsive** user interface design.  \r\n> \r\n> Furthermore, I have strong roots in Computer Science and Information Technology.  I was first exposed to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in their infancies (alongside QBASIC and a dash of Java) sometime around 1997, and have since witnessed the evolution of computers and technology for over twenty years.  My formidable and extensive knowledge of \"*all things computers*\" is bolstered by countless other experiences with such subjects as Relational Databases, Object-Oriented Programming, Computer Architecture, and numerous other theories and concepts in programming and related fields.\r\n> \r\n> In addition to the aforementioned technical prowess, I am well-grounded in the social and physical sciences.  I completed several semesters at Rutgers University towards a B.A. in History.  In my leisurely time, I unofficially passed a select number of high-level Psychology courses, which subsequently led to an interest in Psychiatry and Clinical Pharmacology--fields in which I regularly read scholarly articles from journals of science and medicine.  On top of three semesters spent in Mechanical Engineering, I perform regular maintenance and mechanical repair on my own vehicle, which both resembles and varies from working with hardware found in computers and mobile phones.\r\n> \r\n> Lastly, I possess considerable experience in the world of business, having held previous positions with both retail and wholesale employers, where I proved my worth through applying technical knowledge towards matters of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and profit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Areas of Expertise\r\n\r\nIn descending order of proficiency:\r\n\r\n - AngularJS, Node.js/npm\r\n - Apache-MySQL-PHP\r\n - Gulp Workflow Automation\r\n - RESTful API Design & Integration\r\n - CSS3, Sass/Scss\r\n - Responsive Web Design\r\n - Git & Version Control\r\n - Amazon Web Services\r\n\r\n\r\n### Technical Skills\r\n\r\nBelow is a short list of skills that I have used to a respectable extent in the past.\r\n\r\n - **HTML5**\r\n - **jQuery/Ajax**\r\n - **MongoDB**\r\n - Karma, Jasmine, Protractor\r\n - **Express.js**\r\n - Sails.js\r\n - **PHP**\r\n - CodeIgniter\r\n - Laravel/Lumen\r\n - Slim Framework\r\n - **Python & Django**\r\n - Java & C/C++/C#","google":"UA-64478041-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
